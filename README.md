# Sentiment Analyzr

Sentiment Analyzr uses GPT to analyze the sentiment of any web page and responds with a detailed report which includes a neutralized summary of the page content. It works great on news articles, blog posts, social media threads, political cartoons, etc. At this time, it does not analyze video or audio data. Sentiment Analyzr is currently in beta. It is only available to a limited number of trial users. You may request a trial via [email](mailto:mattbahr1992@gmail.com).
